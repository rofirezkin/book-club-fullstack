  # PostgreSQL database service used by the backend.  It exposes port 5432 on the host
  # so the API and migration scripts can connect via the standard Postgres port.  A
  # named volume keeps your data between container restarts.  The default database,
  # user and password can be customised via environment variables.  See the README
  # for more details.
